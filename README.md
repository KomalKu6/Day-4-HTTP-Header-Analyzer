# Day-4-HTTP-Header-Analyzer
objective: 
Build a python tool that send a request to a target URL and fetches its http response headers to analyze security misconfigurations like:
Missing Security Headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options)
Technologies used (via Server or X-Powered-By headers)
Insecure configurations (e.g., overly permissive CORS)

Why it's Important:
During reconnaissance (especially in bug bounty or red teaming), analyzing headers helps identify:
Server-side technologies (ex: PHP, Nginx, Apache)
Potential misconfigurations (missing headers = security gaps)
Leaky metadata that can guide further attacks

What You'll Learn:
How the requests module works
What HTTP headers reveal about a target
Why missing security headers are risky
How to automate reconnaissance like a pro

Let' go ðŸš€

Features:
Detects 7 critical HTTP security headers
Gives suggestions for missing headers
Fast and easy to use â€” CLI based
Ideal for bug bounty recon and security auditing
Built from scratch to understand the internals

Why I Built This?
As a cybersecurity analyst and bug bounty learner, I wanted to understand how websites secure themselves through HTTP headers. Instead of using existing tools like securityheaders.com, I built my own analyzer in Python â€” this helped me understand:

How to use the requests module
How web servers respond to header requests
How to give security recommendations from missing headers
How to write clean CLI tools for automation
