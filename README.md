# Day-4-HTTP-Header-Analyzer
objective: 
Build a python tool that send a request to a target URL and fetches its http response headers to analyze security misconfigurations like:
Missing Security Headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options)
Technologies used (via Server or X-Powered-By headers)
Insecure configurations (e.g., overly permissive CORS)

Why it's Important:
During reconnaissance (especially in bug bounty or red teaming), analyzing headers helps identify:
Server-side technologies (ex: PHP, Nginx, Apache)
Potential misconfigurations (missing headers = security gaps)
Leaky metadata that can guide further attacks

What You'll Learn:
How the requests module works
What HTTP headers reveal about a target
Why missing security headers are risky
How to automate reconnaissance like a pro
